This presentation will showcase preliminary results from my M.Sc. thesis research on the evolution of gas and dark matter profiles in galactic halos using the NINJA cosmological simulation suite. The talk will cover:

## Key Topics

- **AGN Feedback Effects**: How active galactic nucleus feedback influences the spatial distribution of gas and dark matter in galactic halos
- **Halo Classification**: Methodology for classifying halos into Main Sequence and Feedback Dominated types based on black hole activity
- **Profile Evolution**: Time evolution of gas and dark matter profiles across cosmic time
- **Star Formation Quenching**: Connection between gas-dark matter dissociation and cessation of star formation

## Methodology

- **NINJA Simulations**: Utilization of high-resolution cosmological simulations
- **Profile Analysis**: Advanced techniques for measuring and comparing halo profiles
- **Statistical Framework**: Robust statistical methods for halo classification and evolution tracking

## Preliminary Results

The presentation will include:
- Evidence for systematic differences between Main Sequence and Feedback Dominated halos
- Temporal evolution of profile shapes and their physical interpretation
- Implications for galaxy formation and evolution models

This work represents my first major conference presentation and showcases the research conducted under the supervision of Dr. Nishikanta Khandai at NISER.
