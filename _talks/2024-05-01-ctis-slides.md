This presentation was delivered as part of the P452 course at NISER, focusing on Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS) and the construction of hyperspectral data cubes.

## Project Overview

Under the supervision of Dr. Guneshwar Thangjam and Dr. Subhasish Basak, this project explored advanced techniques in hyperspectral imaging and data analysis.

## Key Topics Covered

### CTIS Technology
- **Imaging Spectrometry**: Simultaneous spatial and spectral information acquisition
- **Computed Tomography**: Reconstruction techniques for 3D spectral data
- **Hardware Configuration**: Optical systems and detector arrays
- **Calibration Methods**: Wavelength and intensity calibration procedures

### Hyperspectral Data Analysis
- **Data Cube Construction**: Assembly of 2D spatial + 1D spectral information
- **Preprocessing**: Noise reduction and artifact correction
- **Spectral Unmixing**: Separation of mixed pixel spectra
- **Classification Methods**: Automated identification of spectral signatures

### Applications
- **Remote Sensing**: Earth observation and environmental monitoring
- **Astronomical Spectroscopy**: Multi-object spectral analysis
- **Medical Imaging**: Tissue characterization and disease detection
- **Material Science**: Compositional analysis and quality control

## Technical Implementation
