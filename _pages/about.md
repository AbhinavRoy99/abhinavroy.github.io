Welcome! I'm Abhinav Roy.


I recently graduated with an Integrated M.Sc in Physics (2020-25) from the [National Institute of Science Education and Research (NISER)](https://www.niser.ac.in/), India.


My academic interests broadly lie in the realm of computational astrophysics, specifically the evolution of galactic structure formation and evolution.


Amidst the coding frenzy on my laptop, I also find solace in stargazing, reading novels, usually fiction or comics, listening to music, or trying to find a rhyme to a half-finished stanza. So whether you're fascinated by the cosmos or simply up for a friendly chat, feel free to reach out.
