My research spans computational astrophysics, cosmological simulations, and observational astronomy. I am particularly interested in understanding the complex interplay between galaxies, dark matter halos, and feedback mechanisms that shape cosmic evolution.

## Evolution of Gas & DM Profiles of Galactic Halos in Cosmological Simulations
**M.Sc. Thesis Project (August 2024 - Present)**  
*Supervisor: Dr. Nishikanta Khandai, NISER*

I am investigating how Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) feedback influences the spatial distribution of gas and dark matter in galactic halos using the NINJA cosmological simulation suite. My work focuses on:

- Classifying halos into Main Sequence and Feedback Dominated types based on black hole activity
- Analyzing the dissociation of gas and dark matter profiles over cosmic time
- Understanding the connection between halo transformation and star formation quenching
- Tracking structural evolution across different redshift epochs

**Tools**: MP-GADGET, ROCKSTAR, Python, C++

## Forecasting BBH Mergers with Cosmological Simulations (May 2023 - Present)
**Computational Project, IUCAA VSP**  
*Supervisors: Prof. Shasvath J. Kapadia (IUCAA) & Dr. Nishikanta Khandai (NISER)*

This project aims to forecast statistics of binary black hole (BBH) mergers detectable by future gravitational wave detectors using MP-GADGET cosmological simulations. Key aspects include:

- Analyzing mass distribution and redshift evolution of BBH systems
- Predicting detectability rates for next-generation GW detectors
- Studying galaxy properties and environmental factors affecting BBH formation
- Tracking evolution of host region properties as BBH merger precursors
