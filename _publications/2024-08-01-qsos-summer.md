This comprehensive study investigates the relationship between quasars and dark matter halos through advanced statistical analysis of observational data and cosmological simulations.

## Project Overview

As part of a collaborative group project at TIFR, this work focuses on understanding how quasars serve as tracers of the underlying dark matter distribution in the universe.

## Methodology

### Observational Data Analysis
- **eBOSS Survey**: Utilized extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey data
- **Correlation Functions**: Calculated projected correlation functions for different source populations
- **Statistical Analysis**: Applied advanced statistical techniques to quantify clustering properties

### Simulation Work
- **MP-GADGET Simulations**: Leveraged high-resolution cosmological N-body simulations
- **Halo-Galaxy Connection**: Investigated the relationship between QSOs and their host dark matter halos
- **Mock Catalogs**: Generated synthetic QSO catalogs for comparison with observations

## Key Research Questions

1. How do quasar properties correlate with their host halo masses?
2. What environmental factors influence quasar activity and luminosity?
3. How does the QSO-halo connection evolve with redshift?
4. Can we use QSOs to constrain cosmological parameters?

## Preliminary Results

- Identified strong correlations between QSO luminosity and host halo mass
- Demonstrated environmental dependence of quasar clustering
- Established robust statistical framework for QSO-halo modeling
- Developed improved methods for mock catalog generation

## Ongoing Work

This project continues to evolve with:
- Extended redshift analysis
- Improved halo occupation distribution modeling
- Integration with other large-scale structure probes
- Preparation for next-generation survey data
