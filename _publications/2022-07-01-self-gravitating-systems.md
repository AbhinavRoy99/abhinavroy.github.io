This reading project provided a thorough foundation in galaxy dynamics and the physics of self-gravitating systems, forming the basis for my subsequent research in cosmological simulations.

## Scope of Study

### Galaxy Dynamics
- **Stellar Dynamics**: Orbital mechanics in galactic potential wells
- **Collisionless Systems**: Kinetic theory and phase space evolution
- **Gravitational Instabilities**: Jeans criterion and structure formation
- **Relaxation Processes**: Two-body relaxation and violent relaxation

### Galactic Structure
- **Morphological Classification**: Hubble sequence and galaxy types
- **Surface Brightness Profiles**: Exponential disks and de Vaucouleurs profiles
- **Rotation Curves**: Observed vs. predicted from visible matter
- **Dark Matter**: Evidence and distribution in galactic halos

### Theoretical Framework
- **Potential Theory**: Multipole expansions and basis function methods
- **Distribution Functions**: Equilibrium solutions and modeling approaches
- **Stability Analysis**: Modal analysis and secular evolution
- **N-body Methods**: Numerical techniques for galaxy simulation

## Key Learning Outcomes

### Analytical Skills
- Derived potential and mass distribution models for observed galactic structures
- Analyzed stability conditions for various galaxy configurations
- Applied statistical mechanics to stellar systems

### Physical Understanding
- Comprehended the role of dark matter in galaxy formation and evolution
- Understood the connection between galaxy morphology and formation history
- Grasped the importance of angular momentum in disk galaxy formation

### Research Preparation
- Developed strong foundation for cosmological simulation work
- Gained appreciation for observational constraints on galaxy models
- Prepared for advanced topics in galaxy formation theory

## Applications to Current Research

The knowledge gained in this project directly supports my current work on:
- Dark matter halo profiles in cosmological simulations
- Galaxy-halo connection modeling
- Understanding feedback effects on galactic structure
- Interpreting simulation results in observational context

## Further Reading
This project involved extensive study of classic texts including:
- Binney & Tremaine: "Galactic Dynamics"
- Mo, van den Bosch & White: "Galaxy Formation and Evolution"
- Schneider: "Extragalactic Astronomy and Cosmology"
