This report presents detailed analysis of solar observations conducted as part of the Experimental Lab II course at NISER. The study encompasses two main components:

## Solar Limb Darkening Analysis

Quantified the solar limb darkening effect using reflective telescopes equipped with CMOS sensors. The project involved:
- Systematic photometric measurements across the solar disk
- Image processing and calibration techniques
- Comparison with theoretical limb darkening models
- Statistical analysis of intensity variations

## Solar Rotation Period Determination

Calculated the Sun's rotation period through careful tracking of sunspot movements over a 3-month observation period:
- Daily monitoring and photography of sunspot groups
- Feature tracking algorithms for position measurement
- Differential rotation analysis across solar latitudes
- Error analysis and uncertainty quantification

## Key Findings

- Measured limb darkening coefficient in excellent agreement with literature values
- Determined solar rotation period with high precision
- Developed robust observational and data analysis techniques
- Gained valuable experience with solar observation safety protocols
