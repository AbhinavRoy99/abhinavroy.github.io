This project involved the complete design, construction, and calibration of a stellar spectrometer system for high-resolution spectral analysis of stellar targets.

## Spectrometer Design & Construction

- **3D-printed housing**: Custom-designed spectrometer housing optimized for stability and light collection
- **Diffraction grating**: High-quality transmission grating for spectral dispersion
- **CMOS sensor**: Scientific-grade sensor for precise photon detection and measurement
- **Optical alignment**: Careful calibration of optical elements for maximum resolution

## Observational Campaign

Conducted systematic spectroscopic observations of five carefully selected stellar targets:
- Stars spanning different spectral types and magnitudes
- Multiple observation sessions for statistical reliability
- Wavelength calibration using known spectral lines
- Flat-field and dark current corrections

## Data Analysis & Results

- **Spectral extraction**: Developed custom software for extracting 1D spectra from 2D images
- **Wavelength calibration**: Achieved precise wavelength solutions using calibration lamps
- **Stellar classification**: Identified spectral features and determined stellar parameters
- **HST comparison**: Excellent agreement with Hubble Space Telescope reference spectra

## Key Achievements

- Successfully designed and built a functional stellar spectrometer from scratch
- Achieved spectral resolution comparable to commercial instruments
- Demonstrated proficiency in both hardware development and data analysis
- Validated results against high-quality reference data
