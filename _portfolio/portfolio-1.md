## Overview

My primary research focus involves using state-of-the-art cosmological N-body simulations to investigate fundamental questions in galaxy formation and evolution. This work combines theoretical astrophysics with high-performance computing to understand how galaxies and their dark matter halos evolve over cosmic time.

## Current Projects

### M.Sc. Thesis: Gas & Dark Matter Profile Evolution
**Duration**: August 2024 - Present  
**Supervisor**: Dr. Nishikanta Khandai, NISER

Investigating how AGN feedback influences gas and dark matter distributions in galactic halos using the NINJA simulation suite. This work focuses on understanding the physical mechanisms that drive galaxy evolution and quenching.

**Key Techniques**:
- MP-GADGET cosmological simulations
- ROCKSTAR halo identification
- Custom analysis pipelines in Python/C++
- Statistical modeling of halo populations

### Binary Black Hole Merger Forecasting
**Duration**: May 2023 - Present  
**Collaborators**: Prof. Shasvath J. Kapadia (IUCAA), Dr. Nishikanta Khandai (NISER)

Using cosmological simulations to predict detection rates of binary black hole mergers for next-generation gravitational wave detectors.

**Research Goals**:
- Characterize BBH merger rate evolution with redshift
- Study environmental factors affecting merger rates
- Develop observational forecasts for future GW missions

## Technical Skills Developed

- **Simulation Codes**: MP-GADGET, GADGET-4, ROCKSTAR
- **Programming**: Python, C/C++, Shell scripting
- **High-Performance Computing**: Parallel programming, cluster computing
- **Data Analysis**: Large dataset handling, statistical modeling
- **Visualization**: Scientific plotting, 3D rendering of simulation data
